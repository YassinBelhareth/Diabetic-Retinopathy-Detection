# ðŸ©º Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Deep Learning

This repository contains a complete pipeline for detecting **diabetic retinopathy (DR)** from retinal fundus images using deep learning.  
It is based on the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset (Kaggle) and includes multiple state-of-the-art computer vision models and evaluation strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Given a retinal fundus image, classify it into one of the five DR severity levels:

| Label | Description         |
|-------|--------------------|
| 0     | No DR               |
| 1     | Mild                |
| 2     | Moderate            |
| 3     | Severe              |
| 4     | Proliferative DR    |

This is an **ordinal classification** task â€” classes have a natural order, and misclassifications far apart in severity are penalized more heavily.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **EfficientNetV2-S** for baseline classification
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for model comparison
- **Ordinal regression (CORN)** for severity modeling
- Data augmentation optimized for retinal fundus images
- Robust evaluation using **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)**
- Tuned decision thresholds for optimal performance

## ðŸ–¥ Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Adjust dataset paths as needed.
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate models.
